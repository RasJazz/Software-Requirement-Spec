# CS250 - Software Requirements Specification Document Project

This outlines all the requirements of the Software Requirements Specification document and any accompanying documents. This project is a work in progress and is updated during the course of the semester. Any instances of the word "you", "you're", etc. addresses the authors of these documents specifically. The below descriptions were the deliverable requirements for the assignment.

### [Software Requirements Specification](https://github.com/RasJazz/CS250/blob/02ba6fc4187e4b8ecdc70ad0cb21218f8444e579/SRS.pdf)

For this assignment you will specify the requirements for a software system. Software systems are assigned during in-class interviews, and your information about your application to specify will come from in-class client interviews. In these interviews, you will ask your "client" (other students) about the application you are expected to specify.

The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to write a fairly complete and precise requirements specification, which is a critical step in developing a large software system. You will utilize all of the methods discussed to elicit requirements, including from the client directly. Client interviews will be held during lecture. 

The deliverable is a single electronic document that contains your software requirement specification. Fill out the first few pages including Functional and non-functional requirements. This document will be used as bases for subsequent assignments (to complete sections of design, testing, ..etc.).

You're also required to submit THREE Use cases.

### [Software Design Specification](https://github.com/RasJazz/CS250/blob/02ba6fc4187e4b8ecdc70ad0cb21218f8444e579/Test_Plan_Docs/SDS.pdf)

The second deliverable in the course project (after the requirement specification) is the software design specification that describes the software organization and development plan. In contrast to the software requirements specification that is intended to be read by the client, the software design document is meant for the developers that implement the software components and later maintain the software product. Specifically, the software design specification document should describe the overall software architecture and implementation, at a level of detail similar to a UML Class Diagram. The classes, data structures, together with all major functions and their parameters should be specified.

The document submitted by your team should include the following content:

Title page
* Software title
* Team members

System Description
* Brief overview of system

Software Architecture Overview
* Architectural diagram of all major components
* UML Class Diagram
* Description of classes
* Description of attributes
* Description of operations

\* descriptions should be detailed and specify datatypes, function interfaces, parameters, etc..

Development plan and timeline
* Partitioning of tasks
* Team member responsibilities

### [Verification Test Plan](https://github.com/RasJazz/CS250/blob/02ba6fc4187e4b8ecdc70ad0cb21218f8444e579/Test_Plan_Docs/Verification_Test_Plan.pdf)

In this assignment your group will outline a test plan for your software system you designed in Assignment 2, and add it to your Software Design Specification document. If necessary, you should update your original Software Design Specification with a new class diagram. The assignment is a continuation of your group project, meaning there is only one turning required per group, and you will continue with the same group and software system you have been working on for Assignment 2.

* **Software Design Specification:** This is an up-to-date version of your Software Architecture Overview (UML Class Diagram + description) from Assignment 2.
* **Verification Test Plan:** This section lays out test plans for verification.  In addition to the test itself, you will need to clearly explain your test. Be as detailed as possible, identifying what features of your design you are testing, what the test sets/vectors are, and how your selected test(s) cover the targeted feature(s).
* <strong>[Test Case](https://github.com/RasJazz/CS250/blob/02ba6fc4187e4b8ecdc70ad0cb21218f8444e579/Test_Plan_Docs/Test_Cases_Spreadsheet.pdf) samples</strong>: Provide 10 test case samples using the Excel Test Case template 

You are required to include at least two test sets for each of the three granularities discussed in class (unit, functional, system).
